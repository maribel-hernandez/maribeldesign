            Snap Design Academy is a 6-week academy for Los Angeles' Community College students to learn design from Snap employees and LA-based artists. Throughout the academy,
            we had the opportunity to work on a variety of different assignments that allowed our imagination to overflow and gain on-hands expierence. Below are the assignments I execuated
            during my time in the academy.
