                    <p>Hola, hola üëãüèΩ My name is Maribel and I am a business major, who somehow recently became an aspiring graphic designer. 
                        In 2018, I received my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a Marketing Concentration and graduated cume 
                        laude from the University of La Verne. Upon graduation, I worked with Univision‚Äôs Multi Channel Network (MCN), Univision 
                        Creator Network (UCN), as a freelance campaign manager. In my role, I had the opportunity to manage a variety of influencer 
                        branded campaigns that generated over $100 million dollars in revenue yearly. I gained many valuable skills that has allowed 
                        me to expand my critical thinking, organize my workflow process, and manage a wide-range of clients.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>Although the experience was amazing, I always found myself wanting to create decks or design handbooks. I wanted to learn adobe illustrator, 
                            photoshop, and all the apps in the creative suite but ‚Äúnever had the time.‚Äù When my contract with UCN was ending, I decided to shift gears 
                            and pursue a career in graphic design. I had no idea what to expect, nor did I know anyone in the field that could help me navigate through 
                            this career change. However, I managed to figure it out and began taking graphic design courses at Santa Monica College (SMC). I instantly fell 
                            in love with graphic design and knew that this was the path I was destined to follow. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p>My attention to detail, passion, and ambition for perfection guides my design decisions as I want to ensure my work is the best it could possibly be. 
                            I am currently in pursuit of a certificate in graphic design at SMC with hopes of completion in Spring 2021.
