            Snap Design Academy is a 6-week academy for Los Angeles' Community College students to learn design from Snap employees and LA-based artists. Throughout the academy,
            we had the opportunity to work on a variety of different assignments that allowed our imagination to overflow and gain on-hands expierence. Below are the assignments I execuated
            during my time in the academy.

                    Each student was paired with a Snap Mentor based on our similarities and career goals. For our first assignment, we were required to interview our mentor in 
                    order to get to know them a little better. Based on our interviews we were tasked to create three icons that 
                    represented our mentors. As designers, we needed to listen, understand, and visually communicate our mentors through icons. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-jyVHwlwL7UGVXftT3VWvVeEpAlVEd0H/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Click here to view full deck.</a>

                            note was created to represent his love for music and its fluidity.

                    <p>In addition to the three icons we created for our mentors, we needed to design four collages 
                        that translate emotions, personality, behaviors, and other qualities of human significance into elements of form through collaging.</p>

                    <p>After a couple of meetings with my mentor, I was able to learn more about his personal journey and career path. Throughout our conversations, 
                        I found that he appreciates a more simplistic and modern design approach. He shared that he enjoyed creating magazine layouts and found typography to 
                        be a great form for design. As a result, my goal for this assignment was to ensure a good layout with minimal images to represent my mentor, Joevanno.</p>

                    <p>As designers it is important for us to understand and articulate a design aesthetic that draws unintentionally from historical 
                        cultural design practices to communicate a message. Therefore, using Adobe Illustrator, our task for this assignment was to 
                        make a digital mock of a design and apply an intentional design aesthetic to design an image that captures the spirit of our community via a Geofilter. </p>

                        I was born and raised in Los Angeles and grew up seeing a lot of murals and art pieces all over the city. As a result, murals became my 
                        inspiration for this assignment. I wanted to find a way in which I could leverage Snapchat in order to highlight unnoticed murals in my 
                        community. My goal was to create a space for conversation with friends and showcase the very underrated artist that make L.A so beautiful 
                        with their artwork. Therefore, I decided to create a campaign called, #MuralMadness, that uses the lenses in the Snap carousel to help friends 
                        share murals in their surrounding areas. Check out the three lenses below:

                        <p>
                            Therefore, we were committed in helping Art + Pratcice with brand awareness, so that they can 
                            reach even more foster youth and/or potential donors. In addition, we wanted to leverage Snapchat 
                            in order to help with our goal. As a result we created both a physical experience and used digital 
                            to help further our mission of brand awareness. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/195aSjkBjPg0U0AYsbazdfQQFXr8vjbv5/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Click here to watch our full presentation.</a>

                            <p>The best way for Art and Practice to showcase talented artists and highlight foster youth is through a mural campaign we created called, #ResilienceThruArt. 
                                This campaign would allow for foster youth to share what resilience means to them. Then, Art and Practice would select a leading artist to create a mural representing 
                                the foster youth’s responses to resilience.

                            <p>The mural would be placed on the museum building of Art and Practice in Leimert Park, to  help start or continue the conversation for 
                                this social cause. It will help create a sense of inclusivity, empowerment, and community for foster youth. The mural will be a continuous 
                                reminder to  foster youth that they are not alone and have a place they can call home, a community to call family, and supporters they can trust.

                            <p>We know that Snapchat is the leader in Augmented Reality, Innovation, and Connection with Real Friends. 
                                Therefore, we believe Snapchat would be able to help Art and Practice further their mission by providing 
                                their platform as a tool to reach their millions of users, while encouraging them to donate and become advocates 
                                for foster youth with Art and Practice. As a result, our team created a new Snap feature, SnapShops, the new way to 
                                promote and fundraise for your organization or business in a fun and innovative way.
